= Disabling ShipwrightBuilds build controller and webhook pod

You can disable ShipwrightBuilds without disabling the shared-resources CSI driver component. Disabling `ShipwrightBuilds` CR removes the `ShipwrightBuilds` build controller and `ShipwrightBuilds` build webhook pod from the `openshift-builds` namespace.

.Procedure

. Disable ShipwrightBuilds by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc patch openshiftbuild cluster --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"shipwright":{"build":{"state":"Disabled"}}}}'
----

The above command disables the build controller and webhook but does not affect the ShipwrightBuilds Custom Resource Definition (CRD).
